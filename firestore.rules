/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for BookWise AI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and private book lists.
 * Public book lists are readable by anyone, but writable only by their owners, with an exception for "likes".
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/book_lists/{bookListId}: Private book lists owned by a specific user.
 * - /public_book_lists/{bookListId}: Public book lists accessible to all.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only read and write their own private book lists.
 * - Public book lists are readable by anyone.
 * - Any authenticated user can "like" a public list (updating the `likes` field).
 * - Only the owner can create, delete, or modify other fields of a public list.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed.
